### License?
I guess since I distribute a binary and a header file of [Substitute](https://github.com/comex/substitute) I have to use GNU Lesser General Public License >= 2.1, so: [LGPL v3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html).

Also if you do make some changes, feel free to make a pull request and help make things more awesome!
